    <h1>Gluehwein</h1>
    <p>Gluehwein, also spelled Glühwein, is a hot spiced "glow wine" that's found in many winter markets in Germany and Austria. Many tourists know it as an after-ski drink. After you come in from being out in the cold and snow, this warm, spicy mulled drink is supposed to make you "glow" with warmth again. Watch out — the alcohol in this warm beverage can quickly go to your head, so you might want to plan on staying in afterwards! This is the recipe my father would make for New Year's Eve.</p>

    <p>Warm up from the inside out with this cozy Glühwein recipe. Subtly spiced cloves and cinnamon, you'll want to make this orange-infused wine all season long.</p>
    <h2>What Is Glühwein?</h2>
    <p>Glühwein is German mulled wine. The word translates to "glow wine" because the boozy beverage will make you feel lit from within!</p>
    <h2>Best Wine for Glühwein</h2>
    <p>Use dry red wine, such as Chianti or cabernet sauvignon. Don't use something you wouldn't want to sip on, but you also don't want to waste your most expensive bottles.</p>
    <p>No matter what you use, make sure you add the wine to the mixture when it is hot but not simmering (so the alcohol doesn't boil out).</p>
    <h2>How to Make Glühwein</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this cozy Glühwein:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the water, sugar, and cinnamon stick to a boil. Reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cut an orange in half and squeeze the juice into the mixture.</li>
        <li>Push the cloves into the outside of the orange peel. Place into the simmering mixture.</li>
        <li> Simmer until the mixture is thick and syrupy. Remove from heat.</li>
        <Li> Stir in the wine while the mixture is hot, but not simmering.</Li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Serve Glühwein</h2>
    <p>Remove the cinnamon stick and orange peel, then ladle the Glühwein into stoneware mugs. Garnish with orange wedges. If you choose to serve the drink in glass mugs, make sure to heat them with hot water first so the glass doesn't shatter.</p>
    <h2>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h2>
    <p>"Utterly fantastic," raves wenzk. "I made this for my husband and he was just as impressed, the smell in our house was great and the deep rich warming effect. Lovely!"</p>
    <p>"I was in Frankfurt, Germany last year for their Christmas Market," says one Allrecipes community member. "All you can smell is Gluehwein, there is a vendor every few feet. It was the best thing I had ever tasted! This recipe is exactly like I remember it."</p>
    <p>"Often, I like to add a few splashes of brandy," according to Sarah. "It makes it a bit more potent, which is especially nice if your wine got a little too warm and some alcohol evaporated."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>2 medium oranges, divided</li>
        <li>10 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 (750 milliliter) bottle red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cut one orange in half; squeeze orange halves over the sugar mixture to release their juice. Push 5 cloves into the outside of each orange peel; place peels into the simmering mixture. Continue to simmer over the lowest heat until thick and syrupy, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the mixture is simmering, slice remaining orange and set aside for serving.

        </li>
        <li>When the mixture is finished simmering, stir in wine and heat until steaming but not simmering, 3 to 5 minutes. Discard orange peels and cinnamon stick.</li>
        <li>Ladle into stoneware mugs and garnish with orange slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
